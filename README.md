Additional questions:

1. In AI we generally work with huge data sets, what are other sources you know like kaggle for getting access to these collections of sample data sets?

Answer: Some other sources for datasets are
            - Data.gov
            - Github
            - Google dataset search

2. After the implementation, do you feel comfortable working with ML tools and technologies? What are the challenges you faced and the learning you got from the implementation.

Answer: I have implemented other ML projects (including in CIS479 Deep Learning) so I already felt comfortable with the tools. I did run into issues with .dot graph preview extension proposed in the reference video but I was able to overcome by installing a different extension (see music_genre_pred_submission.pdf)
